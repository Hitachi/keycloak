=== Passkeys

{project_name} provides preview support for https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/[Passkeys]. {project_name} works as a Passkeys Relying Party (RP).

Passkey registration and authentication are realized by the features of xref:webauthn_{context}[WebAuthn].
Therefore, users of {project_name} can do Passkey registration and authentication by existing xref:webauthn_{context}[WebAuthn registration and authentication].

[NOTE]
====
Both synced Passkeys and device-bound Passkeys can be used for both Same-Device and Cross-Device Authentication (CDA).
However, Passkeys operations success depends on the user's environment. Make sure which operations can succeed in https://passkeys.dev/device-support/[the environment].

==== Passkey Authentication with Conditional UI

Passkey Authentication with Conditional UI can authenticate a user with its passkey in the same way as in xref:_webauthn_loginless[LoginLess WebAuthn].
This authentication shows a user a list of passkeys stored on a device where the user runs a browser.
Therefore, the user can select one of the passkeys in the list to authenticate them. Compared with xref:_webauthn_loginless[LoginLess WebAuthn], the authentication improves the user's experience of authentication.

[NOTE]
====
This authentication uses the https://github.com/w3c/webauthn/wiki/Explainer:-WebAuthn-Conditional-UI/[WebAuthn Conditional UI].
Therefore, this authentication success depends on the user's environment.
If the environment does not support WebAuthn Conditional UI, this authentication falls back to xref:_webauthn_loginless[LoginLess WebAuthn].

.Procedure
===== Setup

Set up Passkey Authentication with Conditional UI as follows:

. (if not already present) Register a new required action for WebAuthn passwordless support. Use the steps described in <<_webauthn-register, Enable WebAuthn Authenticator Registration>>. Register the `Webauthn Register Passwordless` action.

. Configure the `WebAuthn Passwordless Policy`. Perform the configuration in the Admin Console, `Authentication` section,  in the tab `Policies` ->  `WebAuthn Passwordless Policy`. Set *User Verification Requirement* to *required* and *Require discoverable credential* to *Yes* when you configure the policy for loginless scenario. Note that since there is no dedicated Loginless policy, it is impossible to mix authentication scenarios with user verification=no/discoverable credential=no and loginless scenarios (user verification=yes/discoverable credential=yes). Storage capacity is usually very limited on passkeys meaning that you cannot store many discoverable credentials on your pass key.

. Configure the authentication flow. Create a new authentication flow, add the "WebAuthn Passwordless" execution and set the Requirement setting of the execution to *Required*

The final configuration of the flow looks similar to this:

.Passkey Authentication with Conditional UI flow

Add the required action `WebAuthn Register Passwordless` to a user who is already known to {project_name}, to test this. The user with the required action configured will have to authenticate (with a username/password for example) and will then be prompted to register a passkey to be used for loginless authentication.

[NOTE]
====
From https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-3/[Web Authn Level 3], *Resident Key* was replaced with *Discoverable Credential*.

If a user's browser supports https://github.com/w3c/webauthn/wiki/Explainer:-WebAuthn-Conditional-UI/[WebAuthn Conditional UI], the follwing screen is shown.

When the user clicks the *Select your passkey* textbox, a list of passkeys stored on a device where the user runs a browse is shown as follows.

If a user's browser does not support https://github.com/w3c/webauthn/wiki/Explainer:-WebAuthn-Conditional-UI/[WebAuthn Conditional UI], the authenticaion falls back to the xref:_webauthn_loginless[LoginLess WebAuthn] as follows.
